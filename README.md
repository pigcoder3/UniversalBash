# Universal Bash
   
A place for my bash scripts I want to put on other machines
   
### setup
   
run `./setup` to add the scripts directory to the `PATH`

This is done by changing the `PATH` in `HOME/.profile` or `HOME/.bash_profile`

### Scripts inside

 - fe - finds and edits a file frmo any directory without knowing the exact path (Also called iron)
